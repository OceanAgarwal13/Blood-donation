const bloodDetails = {
  'A+': {
    receive: ['A+', 'A-', 'O+', 'O-'],
    donate: ['A+', 'AB+'],
    info: `A+ is one of the most common blood types, making up about 30% of the population. 
It is extremely important in emergency and surgical procedures due to its wide compatibility. 
A+ individuals can donate to A+ and AB+ and receive from A+, A-, O+, and O-.`,
  },
  'A-': {
    receive: ['A-', 'O-'],
    donate: ['A+', 'A-', 'AB+', 'AB-'],
    info: `A- is a rare blood type, found in less than 7% of people. 
It is highly valued for its ability to be used for A and AB recipients, especially in Rh-negative cases. 
A- individuals can only receive from A- and O-.`,
  },
  'B+': {
    receive: ['B+', 'B-', 'O+', 'O-'],
    donate: ['B+', 'AB+'],
    info: `B+ accounts for around 9% of the population. 
It plays a vital role in transfusions, particularly in Asian communities where this type is more common. 
B+ individuals can receive from B+, B-, O+, and O-, and can donate to B+ and AB+.`,
  },
  'B-': {
    receive: ['B-', 'O-'],
    donate: ['B+', 'B-', 'AB+', 'AB-'],
    info: `B- is an uncommon type, seen in only about 2% of people. 
It is a crucial donor group for both B and AB recipients due to its Rh-negative compatibility. 
People with B- blood can receive from only B- and O-.`,
  },
  'AB+': {
    receive: ['A+', 'A-', 'B+', 'B-', 'AB+', 'AB-', 'O+', 'O-'],
    donate: ['AB+'],
    info: `AB+ is the universal recipient, meaning these individuals can receive red blood cells from any group. 
It is a rare blood type (about 3% of the population) and is often used in complex medical cases. 
However, AB+ donors can only donate to other AB+ individuals.`,
  },
  'AB-': {
    receive: ['A-', 'B-', 'AB-', 'O-'],
    donate: ['AB+', 'AB-'],
    info: `AB- is the rarest blood type, occurring in less than 1% of people. 
These individuals can receive blood from all Rh-negative groups and donate to both AB- and AB+. 
AB- plasma is also considered universal, making it invaluable in emergencies.`,
  },
  'O+': {
    receive: ['O+', 'O-'],
    donate: ['A+', 'B+', 'AB+', 'O+'],
    info: `O+ is the most common blood type globally, present in about 37% of people. 
Its versatility makes it extremely important in emergencies and trauma care. 
O+ individuals can donate to all positive blood groups and receive from O+ and O-.`,
  },
  'O-': {
    receive: ['O-'],
    donate: ['A+', 'A-', 'B+', 'B-', 'AB+', 'AB-', 'O+', 'O-'],
    info: `O- is the universal donor, meaning anyone can receive O- red blood cells. 
This makes O- the go-to blood type in emergencies when the patientâ€™s blood type is unknown. 
However, O- individuals can only receive blood from other O- donors.`,
